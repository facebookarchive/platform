WP-FacebookConnect uses Facebook Connect to integrate Wordpress with
Facebook.  It provides single-signon, avatars, and newsfeed comment
publication.


=== Installation ===

 1. Copy the plugin to wp-content/plugins/wp-fbconnect under the
 Wordpress installation.
 2. In the Wordpress Admin panel, visit the plugins page and Activate the plugin.
 3. Visit the settings page and select "Facebook Connect".  Follow the
 given instructions to configure the plugin and obtain a Facebook API key.

A minimal amount of theme integration is necessary. Open the
'comment.php' file in the theme and add the following line where the
Connect login button should be inserted:

  `<?php do_action('fbc_display_login_button') ?>`

The reason for calling fbc_comment_login via do_action instead of
directly is to avoid spewing errors if the plugin is disabled.  It
would be equally correct to directly call fbc_comment_login() here.

As a simple example, the comments.php file on my blog looks like:

`<?php if ( $user_ID ) : ?>  `
...
<?php else : ?>
....
<?php endif; ?>

<?php do_action('fbc_display_login_button')  ?>`

Note that the fbc_comment_login function should be called *regardless*
of whether the user is currently logged into WP or not.  It will DTRT.

See config.php and the Settings page for more configuration and
customization options.

=== A note on 'nofollow' ===

When a Facebook Connect user posts a comment the author field of the
comment will link back to that user's public profile page at Facebook.
For instance, my comments link back to
http://www.facebook.com/people/Adam-Hupp/806285106.

To reduce spamming Wordpress automatically adds the nofollow attribute
to all comment links, but this is undesirable when the links are
generated by a trusted source (e.g the plugin).  For this reason the
plugin will remove the nofollow attribute from all Facebook user
comments.  This is configurable on the Settings page.

=== AJAX Login ===

TODO: Example will be implemented in a later release.

=== Known Problems ===

 1. The login status box ("Welcome, youname") has a fixed size instead
 of expanding to fit the name.

=== Future Work ===

 1. Support avatars and newsfeed for blog posters.
 2. Notification when a friend comments on the same article you have.
 3. Widget to display your friends that have visited the blog.
 4. Widget to invite friends to read the article.

=== How Does it Work? ===

The first time a user selects the "Connect" button the plugin will
create a new wordpress user named 'fbN', where N is a Facebook user
id.  The Facebook user id is also stored in the wp_usermeta table
under the key 'fbuid'.  The plugin can securely identify the Facebook
user because it recieved signed session cookies along with the
request.

Once the Wordpress and Facebook account are linked and the Facebook
userid is verified the plugin sets a Wordpress login cookie.  The page
reloads and at this point the user will be logged into the blog.

Most login state handling occurs in fbc_init_auth.

=== Troubleshooting / FAQs ===

 1. I'm not seeing the "Connect" button.
   a. Currently the Connect button will not display for users that are
   currently logged into Wordpress.
   b. Make sure there is a call to wp_head in the header.php file of
   your theme.
